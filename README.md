## Use Case

We can see that the client can carry out the basic activities of the application, which is registering, purchasing, etc.

The admin can manage customer users, glasses, purchase statuses, etc.

And the superadmin can do the same as the admin with the difference that the superadmin can also manage administrative users.

# Project installation
To install the project we must first clone the repository in our homes using the command:
```
git clone https://github.com/AlejandroCruzPulido
```

Once cloned we perform a
```
cd "/ruta"
```
And we enter the backend route and do the following:
```
npm install
```

And we do the same in the frontend route:
```
npm install
```


And now to start the back and the front we do the following:
In the backend:
```
node index.js
```
And in the frontend:
```
npm start
```

# Tests
To perform the test in the backend, we go to the backend path and execute the following command:
```
npx jest tests/user.test.js --forceExit
```
With that, he performs a test on what would happen if we do not pass the address data but if we pass the rest, what happens is that it fails since in the backend that data is essential
